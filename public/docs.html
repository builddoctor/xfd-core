        <p><strong>eXtreme Feedback Device</strong> helps to keep your 
            software project on track by telling everybody in your project 
            room if your project's builds are failing.  
            XFD is a Build Radiator for Continuous Integration servers, like 
            Hudson, CruiseControl or TeamCity.</p>

        <p><strong>How do I use it?</strong>
            Load the URL '<a href="http://xfd.build-doctor.com">http://xfd.build-doctor.com</a>' in a
            modern browser (we like Google Chrome), on a computer display where people can see it. We suggest that
            you put it near the water or coffee points in your office so
            people can notice when walk past it. By default this service 
            connects to our
            'mock' Hudson service to show you what it does. To change these
            settings, click on the "Config" button, and tell us about
            your Continuous Integration server. Click the
            'Update' button, and you should see your CI results on the
            big screen.</p>
        <p>You can also bookmark a URL that has the configuration
            embedded in it using the following parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>engine</strong> - the Continuous Integration server that you want to use - defaults to Hudson</li>
            <li><strong>host</strong> - the hostname that the CI server is installed on</li>
            <li><strong>port</strong> - the TCP port that the CI Server listens on</li>
            <li><strong>context</strong> - where the CI webapp is installed</li>
            <li><strong>interval</strong> - how often to refresh, in seconds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example: <a href="http://xfd.build-doctor.com?port=80&amp;host=hudson">http://xfd.build-doctor.com?port=80&amp;host=hudson</a></p>
        <p>Support: <a href="http://twitter.com/builddoctor" title="build doctor">Tweet me</a> or <a href="mailto:medic@build-doctor.com?Subject=XFD%20message">Email me</a></p>

        <p><strong>Why does this help?</strong> 
            You probably shouldn't deploy your code to production and 
            attempt to make money with it if you have a broken build.
            Everyone on your project team should know if you're ready to 
            hit the launch button or not.  It's their right as a team 
            member, and it's critical information.  Nobody expects the
            build to be green all the time.  It should be green most of the time.              If it's not, that could be a symptom of other issues.

        <p><strong>What makes XFD different?</strong> It runs entirely
            inside a browser (we suggest Firefox or Chrome). Why?g Because
            we beleive that doing the right thing should be easy, and you
            shouldn't have to mess around with your Continuous Integration
            server to get this information.</p>

        <p><strong>What Continuous Integration servers does XFD support?</strong> Out of the box, we support:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/" title="Hudson CI">Hudson</a> CI server.</li>
            <li>Our fork of <a href="http://github.com/builddoctor/cijoe" title="CI Joe">CI Joe</a> (0.9.0 or later has our patch)</li>
            <li>Everyone's Grand-daddy, <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net">CruiseControl</a> (from 2.8.4, using the original Reporting application).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With a plugin, we support <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">Team City</a>. When installing the <a href="https://github.com/cread/tcjson">tcjson</a> plugin, remember to enable guest access.</p>
        <p>With our easy-to-install <a href="http://ccproxy.chris-read.net/">CCTray Proxy</a>, we support:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET">CruiseControl.NET</a> - the first port of CruiseControl and still popular with the .NET community.</li>
            <li><a href="http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/">CruiseControl.RB</a> - the Ruby equivalent of the above.</li>
            <li><a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net">CruiseControl</a> - if you use the newer Dashboard application, you'll need to use cctray rather than our default support.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/go-agile-release-management">Go</a> - also known as Cruise.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What else does it do?</strong>

            We're working on a whole host of features to help you better 
            visualise information about your projects. We think that the needs of 
            software teams aren't being met, and we are working on ways 
            to help improve decision-making so you don't have to.
        </p>

        <p><strong>How will you protect my information?</strong> 
            XFD runs on your browser and connects to your Continuous 
            Integration server directly.  We don't store any project information 
            on our systems.
